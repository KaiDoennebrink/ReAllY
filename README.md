# ReAllY

Your Reinforcement Learning Ally.

A framework based on tensorflow, RAY and gym to handle reinforcement learning tasks.



## General Remarks

This framework was originally build for the block course "Deep Reinforcement Learning" at the University of Osnabr√ºck.
In the block course students are asked to implement standard (deep) RL algorithms with the help of the framework. Sample solutions will be published onec the course is done.

This framework is still under construction and can yet be optimized. If you run into errors or see ways to make something more efficient, please feel free to raise an issue or contact me dircetly (Charlie Lange, chalange@uos.de) and help make this framework better for everyon!
